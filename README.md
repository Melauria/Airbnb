The main goal is to build a model to predict whether a listing will receive a booking request for a calendar night.
    
The dataset used for coding is "data_total.tsv" with over 18,000 rows, but it's too large to upload (exceed the limit uploading size). Hence "data_500.tsv" is uploaded to give an idea of how the data looks like.


STILL IN PROGRESS
